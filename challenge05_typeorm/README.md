### 1.1 TypeORM -> What is it
   It's a technique that allow us to manipulate database using object-oriented
   paradigm. ORM stands for "Object Relational Mapping"

### 1.2 TypeORM -> How it Works
   - The **Object** part is the one you use with your programming language
   - The **Relational** part is a Relational Database
   Manager System there are other types of 
   databases but the most popular is relational ( you know tables, columns, 
   pk fk etc eg Oracle MySQL, MS-SQL )
   - And finally the **Mapping** part is where you do a bridge between your 
   objects and your tables.

### 1.3 TypeORM -> Usage/Problems that solve
   ORM help us with:
   - It fits in your natural way of coding (it's your language!).
   - It abstracts the DB system, so you can change it whenever you want.
   - The model is weakly bound to the rest of the application, so you can change it or use it anywhere else.
   - It lets you use OOP goodness like data inheritance without a headache.

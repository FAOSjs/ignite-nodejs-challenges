### ðŸ—£ Talking about the challenge
Here I just make a simple CRUD using express (that give us tools to build an API), TS (JS superset) and UUID (to generate the repositories ID's).

---

The bigest thing that I want to register here is how to start a TS NODE PROJECT

### ðŸ›  STEP BY STEP 

1. package manager initiation:
`yarn init -y`
2. adding typescript:
`yarn add typescript`
3. adding ts-node-dev -> it's a tool that help us to running our code, obvious on the development environment:
`yarn add ts-node-dev`
4. creating a dev script on the package.json:
`ts-node-dev â€”transpile-only â€”ignore-watch node_modules --respawn src/server.ts`
5. creating the tsconfig file:
`yarn tsc -init`
6. running our code:
`yarn dev`

###  âš™ How to make it Works

1. cloning the project: `git clone`
2. installing dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
3. running: `yarn dev`
